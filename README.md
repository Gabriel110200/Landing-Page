# Landing-Page
 A simple and responsive landing page using html and css
 
Here's a link to my  website: https://gabriel110200.github.io/Landing-Page/ 

I also need to say  that  there is a similar website on codepen and i was inspired by it, HOWEVER the code is 100% mine and I do not own the video either. I just realized it was a good beginner excercise to try to make a similar website. 

Here is also a link to codepen: [click here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL). I hope there isn't any copyrights problems for making this website.
